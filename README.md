# Background

- The climate last about 1 million years has been largely determined but the change of the eccentricity (elongation) of Earth’s orbit (One of the Milankovitch cycles.

- The glacial cycles (daily speaking: ice ages) with a period of about 100 000 years are thought to be due to this.

- Theory: The gravity from the other planets, especially Jupiter, causes the change of the eccentricity.

- **Problem:** Reproduce Milankovitch cycle of eccentricity (100ka)

- **Method:** Use Python
-- Let’s go for functional programming

- **Input:** Some initial positions of the planets but no external data
--Perhaps also user input of length of simulation

- **Output:** Graph of orbits and a timeseries of an eccentricity parameter

**Development steps** (we extend the program with iterations)

-Earth-sun system
-Add Jupiter
-Make modular
-Add more planets?
